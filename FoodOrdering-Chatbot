# FoodOrdering Chatbot 🍽🤖
A serverless FoodOrdering chatbot built using  Amazon Lex, and DynamoDB to take and manage food orders efficiently. This project demonstrates how to implement a natural language processing (NLP) bot for restaurant ordering systems.

## 🚀 Features
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Built with Amazon Lex for handling customer interactions.
- **Order Management:** Uses DynamoDB to store and manage order details.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Fully serverless solution using AWS Lambda for backend logic.
- **API Integration:** Integrated with external payment gateways and notification services (e.g., Amazon SNS).
- **Scalability:** Designed with AWS Lambda and API Gateway to scale on-demand.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **AWS Lambda** for running serverless functions.
- **Amazon Lex** for building the chatbot’s natural language interface.
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for storing order and user data.
- **API Gateway** for exposing endpoints to the chatbot and front-end.


## 💡 How It Works
- Users interact with the chatbot by placing food orders.
- The chatbot handles queries like "What’s on the menu?" or "I’d like to order a pizza."
- The backend, powered by AWS Lambda, processes the orders and stores them in DynamoDB.
- After the order is processed, the chatbot sends a confirmation message and notifies the user.
